    <header ><h1>The Time I spent in the Army</h1></header>
    


    <p>I did my basic training in Ft Jackson, and my AIT at Ft Sill. After all the training I was 
        sent to Ft Bragg. I was Bragg for about 3 years, with a year of that being delpoyed. Living on a 
        mulitary base came with some challenges, such as hearing gunfire and artillary fire randomly
        throughout the day or at night, and sometimes living in the field for up to a month if not longer.
        One of my funniest experiences while in the Army was driving back from New Mexico to North Carolina
        after a 2 week exercise.
        it was a 3 day trip on a bus. The bus I was on got pulled over because the charter company we used
        was known for smuggling in drugs on their buses. It was hilarious when the officer got into the bus
        and asked if we were carrying firearms, and the person in charge told him we were carrying over 30
        M4 rifles, a couple of grenade launchers and a handful of M9s.
    </p>    
        


        <p>
        During my time at Ft Bragg I was deployed to Kuwait and then Bahrain
        for about a year. During that time I was transfered from 1-7 HHB to 1-7 Alpha. However before i 
        transfered I did a wall with HHB. At the end of my deployment with Alpha I did another wall
        so I can happily say I left my name in two places in Bahrain. During my time
        in Bahrain I worked 24 hour shifts every other day, and met the local wildlife.
        Unfortunately I lost the picture of 
        the second wall I did with Alpha, but I have a picture of my wall that I did with HHB.
