    <h2>A little about myself</h2>

    <div class="text">
    <p >Hello and welcome to my CS 601 page. A little about myself, my name is Han Zhang
        and I am currently living in Queens, New York while working on my Masters of 
        Computer Information Systems degree at Met BU. Currently I'm on my 7th course
        and I am on track to finish my degree by the end of spring 2024. I got my Bachlors from
        the University of Rochester in 2015 with a BS in biochemistry. There is an obvious gap of 
        a few years between when I first got my bachlors to now, because I didn't continue my education
        immedietly after I graduated, after I graduated I did a lot of traveling.
    </p>    

    <p >After a couple
        of odd jobs after college I moved to Shanghai China for a year or so, and during that time
        I was enrolled in Fudan University as a foreign exchange student, which I felt was 
        ironic at the time being ethnically chinese and enrolling in China as a foreign exchange student
        however I found out I wasn't the only one, which greatly reduced some personal embarassement I felt at the time.
        During my time China I used Shanghai as a springboard to travel around Asia as quickly and cheaply as possible.
        and when I got back from my travels I enlisted into the Army, and finally after I got out I started this program
        here at Met BU.
    </p>
    
    <p> Enlisting into the Army was one of the best decisions I have ever made. While I fully admit
        I was miserable every day at basic training when I first started and wanted to quit almost daily,
         it eventually helps you become a more disciplined person and greatly fortifies your mental state. 
         When I got to my first duty station in Ft. Bragg I met some of the most intersting people who came from all different
        walks of life from all different parts of America from California to New York and all the states
        in between. I initally wanted to re-enlist but due to some complications I decided against it
        and ended up in the New York National Guard. Finally here I am getting my masters of computers information systems at Met BU

<!-- I ran all my pages through w3 and they were error free except for 
"The character encoding was not declared. Proceeding using windows-1252"
I haven't seen anything in module 1 that explainms how to declare a encoding scape
so I guess it defaults to w-1252. For future reference I would like to know
where and how to incorporate this, and whether or not it is necessary-->
